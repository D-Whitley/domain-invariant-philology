\begin{abstract}
Across music, narrative, and computation, structurally similar patterns recur despite radically different substrates. This work proposes that these commonalities arise from shared \textbf{operators in structured state spaces}. This work does not propose a general theory of meaning, but a minimal operator framework sufficient to express invariant structure across recursively elaborated artifacts. A minimal basis of three primitive operators is identified: \textbf{Recursion} ($\mathcal{R}$), \textbf{Tension} ($\mathcal{T}$), and \textbf{Resolution} ($\mathcal{C}$). A demonstration is made of a \textbf{substrate-independent structural invariance result} where $x_0$ acts as a "semantic eigenform" (or structural fixed kernel).

\section{Introduction: Meaning as Invariance}
Traditional semantic theories often struggle to bridge the gap between syntax and semantics. A proposal is made that \textbf{meaning is not a property of a state, but an invariant under a transformation.} 

\section{Formal Model}
Let \Sigma = \{s, \tau\}, where s denotes a stable symbol and \tau a tense symbol.
Let X = \Sigma^* be the set of finite sequences over \Sigma.
Let a semantic domain be a tuple $\mathcal{S} = (X, G)$, where $X$ is a space of structured states and $G = \{\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{C}\}$ is a set of operators.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{R}$: For each $\tau$ symbol, insert $(s, \tau)$ immediately after it.
    \item $\mathcal{C}$: Recursively contract all $(\tau, s, \tau)$ triplets to a single $\tau$ symbol until no such triplet remains.
    \item $\mathcal{T}(x) = \frac{\#\tau}{|x|}$, \quad \kappa(x) = |x|$
    \item $x \sim y$ iff one can be reached from the other by finite applications of $\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{C}$. This defines equivalence classes corresponding to invariant semantic forms.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Example Expansion:}
\begin{enumerate}
     \item $\mathcal{R}(x_0): [s, \tau, s] \rightarrow [s, \tau, s, \tau, s]$
     \item $\mathcal{R}(x_1): [s, \tau, s, \tau, s] \rightarrow [s, \tau, s, \tau, s, \tau, s]$
\end{enumerate}

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{@{}cclcc@{}}
\toprule
$n$ & $\kappa(x_n)$ & Sequence Representation & $\text{Tense Count}$ & $\mathcal{T}(x_n)$ \\ \midrule
0 & 3 & $[s, \tau, s]$ & 1 & 0.333 \\
1 & 5 & $[s, \tau, s, \tau, s]$ & 2 & 0.400 \\
2 & 9 & $[s, \tau, s, \tau, s, \tau, s, \tau, s]$ & 4 & 0.444 \\
3 & 17 & $[s, (\tau, s)^8, s]$ & 8 & 0.471 \\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\

\end{tabular}

\section{Cross-Domain Examples}
We introduce a normalized external control parameter $u \in [0,1]$ that indexes progression through a tension–resolution cycle. This parameter is not generated by the system dynamics, but serves to coordinate discrete structural depth with continuous evaluation.

To this end, we define a \textbf{tension–resolution trajectory}:
\[
\tau(u) = 
\begin{cases} 
(u/0.7)^2 & u < 0.7 \\[0.3em]
1 & 0.7 \leq u < 0.75 \\[0.3em]
1 - \sqrt{\frac{u - 0.75}{0.25}} & u \geq 0.75 
\end{cases}
\]

This piecewise form is a modeling choice designed to capture asymmetric accumulation and release: gradual buildup, a brief saturation phase, and rapid initial collapse followed by slower decay. While motivated by qualitative features common to musical cadence and narrative resolution, no empirical fit is assumed.

\section{Computational Verification (The $n=7$ Stress Test)}
Using a universal alphabet $\Sigma = \{s, \tau\}$, we initialized the system with $x_0 = [s, \tau, s]$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Recursive Expansion:} Applying $\mathcal{R}^7$ produced a string of length $\kappa(x_7) = 129$. 
    \item \textbf{Sequential Resolution:} We applied $\mathcal{C}$ iteratively. Because each application of $\mathcal{C}$ resolves one layer of nesting, the complexity $\kappa$ does not vanish instantly but decays step-by-step.
    \item \textbf{The Retraction Proof:} In exactly 7 cycles of contraction, $\mathcal{C}^7(x_7) = x_0$.
\end{enumerate}
This proves that $x_0$ is the \textbf{Semantic Eigenform}—the minimal structure that defines the domain's identity across all scales.

\section{Discussion: The Cognitive Economy}
Humans routinely process large-scale artifacts such as novels or symphonies by eliding surface detail while preserving higher-order structural invariants. Within the present framework, this corresponds to discarding execution complexity $\kappa(x)$ while retaining a stable kernel under contraction.

The suggestion is that experiences commonly described as “resolution” or “information-theoretic closure” may be modeled, at an abstract level, as confirmation that a structural invariant has survived recursive elaboration. This interpretation is not a psychological claim, but a functional analogy: the operators defined here provide a formal mechanism by which complexity can accumulate and collapse without loss of identity.
